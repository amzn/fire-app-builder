Fire App Builder is a java framework that allows developers to quickly build immersive, java based Android media applications for Fire TV, without writing code.  Fire App Builder accomplishes this by using a plug and play java framework with easy configuration files.  Developers simply specify the format of their media feed in a json file and add resources for logos and colors to create a rich media TV experience quickly.  Fire App Builder supports multiple modules for Analytics, Authentication and Advertising that you can enable for your app.
