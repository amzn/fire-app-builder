# Port of Exoplayer2 to Amazon Fire App Builder

This is not full featured but a functional port of ExoPlayer2 to the [Fire App Builder](https://github.com/amzn/fire-app-builder) framework.  Use this as a starting point if you are encountering bugs or missing features from the default ExoPlayer used in that framework.

My use case for needing the port was rebuffering when encountering discontinuities in timestamps of live HLS streams.

## Fire App Builder

Fire App Builder is a java framework that allows developers to quickly build immersive, java based Android media applications for Fire TV, without writing code.  Fire App Builder accomplishes this by using a plug and play java framework with easy configuration files.  Developers simply specify the format of their media feed in a json file and add resources for logos and colors to create a rich media TV experience quickly.  Fire App Builder supports multiple modules for Analytics, Authentication and Advertising that you can enable for your app.
